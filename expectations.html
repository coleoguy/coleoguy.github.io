      <p class="w3-text-light-grey2">General lab philosophy</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
          I am invested in your success. I define success as the ability to graduate or move to a new position; this broad definition indicates that I do not care what type of job or position you attain after spending time in my lab, just that your time with me as an advisor or mentor has been productive and helped you advance your career. 
          <br><br>
          I want you to work hard but efficiently while you are in the lab. You should try to hit the goals that we establish for your career without working much more than 40 hours a week.  There are times when more work will be necessary - if we are doing an intense experiment or if you have several manuscripts with deadlines. However, it is imperative that you have a life outside of the lab, exercise, eat good food, feel the sunshine. 
          <br><br>
          On the happiness front, everyone needs to take vacation days during the year. Be sure to communicate with me when you would like to be gone for vacation and for how long, and give me at least 2 weeks notice for short trips (3-4 days) but a much longer head’s up for longer trips (>4 days).
      </p>
      <p class="w3-text-light-grey2">Expectations for ALL lab members:</p>

          <li>Participate in general lab responsibilities (beetle maintenance, maintain common areas, community outreach events)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="w3-text-light-grey2">Postdocs</p>
      <p>
          Postdocs in my lab will be excellent colleagues and mentors to the other members of the lab. Postdoctoral applicants are expected to apply for external funding, with mentorship. If you are interested in joining my lab as a postdoc, please read through the research projects in the lab, and the following expectations and responsibilities, then email me 1) your curriculum vitae, and 2) one page cover letter describing your research interests and background.

          Graduate students in my lab will be trained broadly in evolutionary biology, studying sex chromosomes, genomes, and phenotypic traits. Students will be trained to be excellent colleagues and mentors to the other members of the lab. Graduate students are expected to apply for external funding, and can expect to spend typically 4-6 years to complete a Ph.D. If you are interested in joining my lab as a graduate student, please read through the research projects in the lab, and the following expectations and responsibilities, then email me 1) your CV, and 2) one-page cover letter describing your research interests and background.
