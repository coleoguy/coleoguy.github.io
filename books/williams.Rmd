## Background

George C. Williams - and that quintessential beard

*Adaptation and Natural Selection*[1] was published by Williams in 1966 while at Stony Brook though it was largely written during the summer of 1963 while he was at Berkeley.  It is essentially a reaction to adaptationist story telling and lack of rigor in contemporary explanations for the origins of traits. Williams felt that all too often people explained the origin of a trait as being through selection acting at the level of the species or community.  Williams will argue that this is largely unnecessary and should only be resorted to when individual selection can not explain the phenomenon.

## 1. Introduction

Williams is basically relating why he got frustrated enough to write the book.  The most important part of this chapter is Williams setting up the thesis of the book which is:

> Adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should be used only where it is really necessary. When it must be recognized, it should be attributed to no higher a level of organization than is demanded by the evidence. In explaining adaptation, one should assume the adequacy of the simplest form of natural selection, that of alternative alleles in Mendelian populations, unless the evidence clearly shows that this theory does not suffice.

Doesn't seem like this would have been necessary its basically Occam's razor for evolutionary biologists, and if my memory serves me right that is really the central theme of this book over and over again.  In this introductory chapter he does have one humorous example where he discusses the origin of the occasional exceptionally intelligent human.  He describes the argument that has been made that:  

1. Being particularly intelligent is not associated with higher fitness. 
2. Having a low percentage of geniuses would provide an advantage to a tribe or group of humans.  
3. These tribes or groups would do better and replace groups that lacked the occasional genius.  

He argues that we have no facts that demand this explanation.  He argues that instead it could be that selection for simple and early understanding of basic instructions has selected for a brain sufficient to produce the occasional genius.  The story that he tells to illustrate this is of two young prehistoric children they are warned and spanked for several transgressions.  Then one day they are told to stay in the cave because a *Smilodon* is outside.  One boy is intelligent enough to understand this the other is not and gets eaten.  Williams argues that selection like this is just as likely to be sufficient to produce the observed distribution of intelligence.  He would argue that to resort to the argument for groups needs some compelling evidence that simply can't be explained by selection on individuals.  To me it seems that he is imploring us to use our wit to search for the simplest explanation rather than the sexiest.

## 2. Natural Selection, Adaptation, and Progress

This was a chapter that broached a few topics that were interesting to our group.

1. Evolution doesn't happen because it is needed (to avoid extinction)
2. Evolution doesn't result in *progress*
3. The role of laws in biology
4. The target of selection

These first two I feel are primarily William's response to adaptationist story telling.  We all agree that this is probably a reaction to specific scientists at the time but that also more broadly is still an issue in how science is often communicated to the public.  Part of the discussion of progress gets into information content.  For the untrained it might be tempting to think that we humans are as complex as it gets.  William does a nice job of painting a picture of how complex the life history of many organisms are.  In particular he focuses on organisms that have very different life stages - the liver fluke and tadpole humans make for a great read.  William ends this section by stressing that until we have further information we need to reserve judgment on how *complex* different organisms really are.

Our group disagreed on what we should take away from the discussion that William has concerning biological law. He starts this off with a slap at popgen saying "For all its formal elegance, howerver, this theory (popgen) has provided very limited guidance in the work of biologists."  After our discussion and going back and rereading it myself again.  I think that I have a better understanding of what he was getting at.  Specifically, I believe that his issue isn't with population genetics but rather at the time of writing the lack of rigorous applications of popgen to interesting problems.  He mentions two applications and says that with a hundred more we might have a unified science of adaptation.  He then seems to pin this lack of applications to the underlying cause of messy story telling.

The final topic that we discussed from this chapter was the gene as the target of selection.  William tries to discuss this with an awkward discussion of Socrates.  In this chapter William paints a very Fisherian view of the world.  Because of this our discussion careened off into a 10 minute discussion of the Wright-Fisher debate.  Perhaps the one important distinction that came up during this discussion.  Was the Wrigth vs Fisher view of epistasis. Some of our group members felt that part of the debate was caused because the kind of traits that the two were interested in were characterized by different importances for epistasis.  I disagreed with this.  I think that both viewpoints allow for various amounts of epistasis the difference is whether 1) the role of epistasis can be disregarded because of panmixis (fisherian view) or 2) the role of epistasis must be considered because of population subdivision.
