*Flowering Plants: Evolution above the Species Level*[1] was published by Stebbins in 1974 while at UC Davis.  It is essentially a follow up to arguably his most important contribution to the modern synthesis *Variation and Evolution in Plants*[2].  Stebbins describes his purpose for writing the book as 5 fold:

1. Test the hypothesis of gradualism - higher taxa are generated by the same forces acting on species and populations today.

2. Determine the changes in emphasis when transitioning from a micro to macro evolutionary time scales. For instance does the relative importance of selection, drift, mutation change when looking at different timescales.

3. To describe and analyze the types of adaptive radiations that could have given rise to the traits that taxonomists use to distinguish major lineages.

4. To describe the types of ecological or environmental factors that could have given rise to the traits that taxonomists use to distinguish major lineages.

5. Examine existing theories of the origin of angiosperms.

## Basic Processes of Evolution

We spent the majority of our time discussing just a few points from this chapter.  The first topic that we discussed was the degree to which hybridization events are important as sources of genetic variation.  I think the general consensus that we reached was that yes hybridization can certainly be an important force for novel genetic variation but that the jury is still out on whether or not it is frequently an important source of variation.  Speaking only for myself I feel like Stebbins and many contemporary authors over sell the importance of hybridization.

We all like Stebbins swipe at the "mathematicians who have no experience with actual populations of actual organisms in nature" on page 9.

Next we spent quite a bit of time going over the five corollaries that Stebbins ascribes to genetical uniformitarianism (Stebbins term for gradualism).

1. "Adaptive radiation is the primary basis for diversification both for current groups and those that gave rise to higher orders in the past" I took issue with this when I first read this because I don't feel like there is any inherent reason that adaptive radiation is necessarily required.  If the word primary above was removed I would agree with this statement completely.  Personally I think the jury is out on whether or not MOST extant diversity was generated as part of adaptive radiations.  And perhaps this is a bias due to my background with beetles, but it seems that it is possible that a great deal of the observed diversity that we observe is generated through rare long distance dispersal events that create isolated populations.  These isolated populations could then evolve by drift to have small differences in phenotype.  Taxonomists now come in and recognize these as unique species - which depending on the length of time that they have been separated they may be.  But the question remains are they "good species" because they have adapted to their new locality or because they have been isolated long enough to develop DMIs through drift mediated processes (e.g. differential resolution of duplicated genes). 

2. "The origin of major categories, such as genera and families, does not require the evolution of distinctive characters that are qualitatively different from those that separate at least some populations and species."  To me this seems  like a very reasonable assertion and I think that most people with a organismic background can think of good examples of this in just about any group of interest.

3. "The initial divergence that led to major categories took place under conditions similar to those that promote maximal diversity in the modern world." Again this seems like a fairly straight forward assertion.  The one thing that bothers me a bit about this is that you could imagine that its not the condition that drives diversification but instead maybe its a change in condition that is most important. Additionally I think we still have a great deal of difficulty identifying what is linked to diversification.  So it is a high bar to try and say that the forces important recently are the same as those that were important long ago.

4. "Archaic forms...are most likely to exist in 'museums' that are least favorable for the origin of new species that could compete and cause their extinction"  This is an interesting idea; Stebbins goes on to discuss that no area is likely a cradle, museum, or lab for all species it contains.  It seems like the most important thing in determining if an area is a museum for a species is instead its taxonomic/morphological isolation.  To me this means that the fact that these species that are on an isolated lonely branch of the phylogeny may be the determining factor and not the environment that they are in.  One would expect these species to be phenotypically/physiologically very different from any other species.  If we think of the possible species that can exist being distributed across some multipeak landscape of genotypes we would expect these species to be a peak that is very distant from any other peaks.  This would mean that it would take a great many mutations for any species to be an effective competitor.

5. "Transspecific (macro) evolution is not best studied by focusing on relictual modern phenotypes, instead focus on the differences between modern forms regardless of their phylogenetic position,"  This is really just the forgone conclusion of accepting gradualism.  If the macro and micro are the same then study the micro because this is easier and should reveal what is going on over long time scales as well.

## Evolutionary processes and the origin of higher categories

Stebbins have several arguments in this chapter

1. The categories that differentiate higher categories are not special.  They vary at least in some cases at the level of species or populations.  Stebbins spends quite a bit of time here and does a good job of illustrating that almost anything that can separate families varies at least in some species somewhere.  He also gives some experimental evidence that in traits that don't vary much in nature can vary under selection.  Specifically he shows a picture from the 1968 thesis of Carl Huether [3] that shows that even though corolla lobe number is largely invariant 98% are pentamorous either environmental stress or selection can lead to great variation:

![linanthus](images/linanthus.jpg)

This provides a convenient transition into Stebbins discussion of canalization.  Stebbins wants to link this study in *Linanthus* which is canalization in the sense of Waddington 1962[4]: A trait that is extremely important to fitness develops a variety of buffering characteristics that insure its proper development despite underlying genetic variability. To what he calls evolutionary canalization.

2. The basis of evolutionary canalization: First, full disclosure,  I found his discussion of evolutionary canalization as more difficult to follow than anything else in chapters 1 & 2.  He describes the hypothesis of evolutionary canalization as "at every level...natural selection has included both an internal and external phase...for the kinds of adaptive shifts that give rise to higher categories the internal has been more important than the external"  This "internal selection" is his way of describing that a mutation must work with the rest of the genome to produce a coherent functional organism.  He posits that many of the traits that we use to define higher categories are part of complex structures (genetic pathways) and likely require many concerted changes.  Therefor these are unlikely to all occur often hence they are useful to separate very large clades of species from one another.  Stebbins also explains his choice of the word canalization as being purposeful because like developmental canalization he is suggesting that previous steps matter.. previous steps (adaptations) depend on previous steps (adaptations).  He next goes on to describe 3 principles that evolutionary canalization depends on:

a. Selective inertia - asserts that selection to establish an adaptive gene combination is times greater than that required to maintain it. I decided to write code to simulate this and in the process of writing the code I understand now why he says what he does.  The key fact is that his model assumes that there is no fitness benefit unless you have at least one copy of the adaptive allele at all 5 loci.  If we take "A" to be the more fit version and "a" to be the less fit then e.g. genotype AABBCCDDee would be no better than the genotype aabbccddee.  The two graphs below show the result of 20 iterations simulated under this model.  In both cases the adaptation (1+ derived allele at all loci) provides a 1% increase in fitness.  Although Stebbins doesn't mention a mutation rate context would make us assume a "low" mutation rate so I set it so that on average we get one new origin of both the adaptive and maladaptive allele in each generation.  In the maintenance setting I use the 95% allele frequency that Stebbbins describes and in the adaptation simulation I use a frequency of 10%. So with these initial setting we can see in the left column below that indeed we are able to maintain the coadapted gene complex but not build it up.  As Stebbins suggests a higher selection force is required to initially build the coadapted gene complex this is shown in the left column where the selection benefit is adjusted to 5% (5 times higher).  Note in both cases the adaptation simulation was given 3000 generations to insure that I wasn't missing something the happens at longer scales. 

![selective.inertia](images/selective_inertia.jpg)

  What seems odd to me considering the way that Stebbins has discussed adaptations building upon each other is that his model requires all mutations before any selective benefit arises.  In fact if we decide instead that the genes act additively we get a very different picture.  Below I compare the "Stebbins model" to an additive model where each copy of the derived allele moves us one step closer to the fitness of the homozygous derived genotype.  The results of the simulation illustrate that if our adaptation evolves under the additive model we can build the coadapted gene complex with a lower selective force than under the Stebbins model.  Specifically 100% of iterations fix the adaptation under an additive model while only 15% of iterations fix the adaptation under the Stebbins model.
     
![alternative_to_selective_inertia](images/alternative_to_selective_inertia.jpg)

  Code for these simulations is available in this [repository](https://github.com/coleoguy/stebbins).  Two files are included first a function "selective.inertia.R", and then an R script "stebbins.ex.R" to actually manage the simulations and produce the plots shown above.

b. Conservation of organization - Stebbins argues this is a necessary result of selective inertia however it seems to hinge on the idea of pleiotropic gene action and that you cant easily lose a complex structure he mentions a number of examples of apparently frivolous structures that have been maintained for long periods.  I wonder though if this isn't simply a failure of imagination and that these structures have some unappreciated importance that we are missing.

c. Adaptive modification (evolution) along the lines of least resistance - This is a topic that should be familiar to most modern readers as it has received lots of attention over the last decade in evolutionary biology.  For that reason I'm going to digress and discuss a citation that Stebbins gives: [Ganong 1901](pdfs/ganong-1901.pdf) [5] This caught my eye and I was curious who [Ganong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Ganong) was and what he had to say about this 100+ years ago. 
    
    ![ganong](images/ganong.jpg)
    
    Reading the article it ends up that Ganong was attempting to correct what he thought was a lagging American botanical outlook on the morphology of plants.  At the very bottom of page 428 Ganong discusses "metamorphosis along lines of least resistance".

3. Evolutionary canalization and alternative pathways of adaptation: Next Stebbin posits that because of evolutionary canalization differences in categories are related to categories but that this relation is indirect.

4. Evolutionary success and evolutionary opportunity: Stebbin rightly points out that we should be cognizant of two types of evolutionary success 1) diversification into many species and 2) spread across very wide geographic and ecological range.

5. The significance of extinctions and alterations of distribution patterns: Here Stebbins discusses the way that forerunner species that are likely less specialized are likely pushed into extinction by related forms creating the relative isolation of distinct forms.  This also has the effect of making it unlikely for the direct ancestral form of species to survive to the present.  He finishes the chapter with a short mention of the hazards of using current distributions to attempt to draw conclusions about the origins of species or clades.

## Adaptations for survival

Stebbins' thesis for this section is that in plants adaptation for survival, cross-pollination, and seed (dispersal and establishment) are separate problems that involve different gene networks.  He argues that this is an important difference in comparison to animals where growth, survival, and reproduction are highly integrated and are not divisable - he loosely attributes this to integration among body parts and says that motility, sensory awareness, digestion, excretion require greater integration among body parts than do the activities of plants.  I will be interested at our meeting to get the take of people with a plant background.  Is he underselling plant here?  I mean for instance there was [this study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/S00442-014-2995-6) [6] that showed that plants responded to vibrations from insect chewing by increasing the levels of chemical defenses in their tissues.  So plants are obviously engaging in sensory awareness to some extent... 

In this chapter he attempts to convince us of independence of adaptation for survival by illustrating that adaptation to different environments is common, often convergent, and often involves alteration of the leaves which are the most plastic of structures.  Perhaps he will develop his thesis more fully in the following chapters but having only read this chapter I feel convinced that yes adaptations to survival occur far below the level of higher categories and I'm not sure how this tells us that is more divisable from reproduction or seed establishment than it would be in animals (not all of which are mobile does he make predictions that we should see in animals like sessile corals, barnacles, etc.)
