*Flowering Plants: Evolution above the Species Level*[1] was published by Stebbins in 1974 while at UC Davis.  It is essentially a follow up to arguably his most important contribution to the modern synthesis *Variation and Evolution in Plants*[2].  Stebbins describes his purpose for writing the book as 5 fold:

1. Test the hypothesis of gradualism - higher taxa are generated by the same forces acting on species and populations today.

2. Determine the changes in emphasis when transitioning from a micro to macro evolutionary time scales. For instance does the relative importance of selection, drift, mutation change when looking at different timescales.

3. To describe and analyze the types of adaptive radiations that could have given rise to the traits that taxonomists use to distinguish major lineages.

4. To describe the types of ecological or environmental factors that could have given rise to the traits that taxonomists use to distinguish major lineages.

5. Examine existing theories of the origin of angiosperms.




_______
## Basic Processes of Evolution
