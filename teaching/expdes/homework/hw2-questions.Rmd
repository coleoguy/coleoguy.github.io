## The challenge

In this homework I want you to make a really beautiful plot of this [betta fish data](../datasets/betta.csv) that is on the course website. The assignment was to produce visualizations that showed at least two different interesting patterns in the data and at least three variables. Below I have a few examples that I think do this well.
