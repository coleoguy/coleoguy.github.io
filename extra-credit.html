Cichlids often use visual cues to recognize and choose mates. Lake Victoria is a lake in East Africa. Due to pollution and loss of planktivorous fish, it has increased turbidity (due to algae). In lake Victoria, this has led to a loss of species barriers among closely related species of cichlids, which now hybridize. You are curious whether fish in Lake Malawi faces a similar threat if the water there becomes less clear. You set up two mesocosms, one with turbid water and one with clear water. In each tank, you place two closely related species. For each species, you have ten females and ten males. You allow the fish to mate freely, producing offspring. After 30 days, you remove all adults and grow the offspring to the point that you can assign them as being of pure origin (both parents species one or both parents species two) or hybrids between species one and two. Your results are:<br><br>
		
Turbid mesocosm 150 pure species offspring and 97 hybrids offspring.<br>
Clear mesocosm 230 pure species offspring and 112 hybrid offspring.<br><br>

Use the base R function mosaicplot to make a good visualization of this data and employ an appropriate statistical test (that we covered before the midterm to determine if water clarity has an impact on the frequency of hybridization. <br><br>

Turn in a one page print off that has:<br>
1) Your plot (max size 3" tall and 4" wide)<br>
2) A two sentence description of your result and your interpretation of your analysis <br><br>

Example sentence: I performed a two-way ANOVA to test for a difference in the size of fish from lake 1 and 2. I found that fish from the lakes differ in size (p-value = 0.001) and that fish from lake 1 are larger.<br>
