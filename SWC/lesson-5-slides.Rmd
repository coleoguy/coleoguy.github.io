## Goals

>- Learn 10 basic rules to make your code more awesome.
>- Apply to an existing script



## 1. Start your code with a header (who, what, when, & **why**):
```{r}
# Heath Blackmon
# coleoguy@gmail.com
# This script explores the frequency of eruptions at the Old Faithful geyser
# 28 Jan 2016
```

## 2. Run all of your import statments `library()` at the begining.
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(vegan)
```

## 3. One should exercise caution when using `setwd()`. 

Changing directories in your script can limit reproducibility:  

If you must use `setwd()`, it is best to put it at the top of the script to avoid this problem.

```
Error in setwd("~/path/to/working/directory") : cannot change working directory
```
## better option

If you're collaborating consider having source files online. This way your collaborators can run your code without making changes.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv(url("http://coleoguy.github.io/SWC/geyser.csv"))

rather than:

dat <- read.csv(file = "/Users/heath/files/dataset-2013-01.csv")
```


## 4. Use `#` or `#-` to set off sections of your code 
[complex R function](https://github.com/coleoguy/evobir/blob/master/R/AncCond.R)


## 5. If you have functions segregate them
If you just have a few put them at the top of your code, so they are among the first things run. If you have written many functions, put them all in their own .R file, and `source` them. Source will run all of these functions so that you can use them as you need them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("my_genius_fxns.R")
```

## 6. Use consistent style within your code.
I largely follow <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml> the most important thing is to be consistent.

## 7. Keep your code modular. 
>100 lines = __Automate__ 

Don't repeat yourself use a loop or a function to do the same thing. 

## 8. Develop a simple directory structure for projects/manuscripts.  

![folder.structure](./images/dummy.png)

## 9. peer review 
We do it for methods and papers, why not code? Our code is a major scientific product and the result of a lot of hard work!  Find a friend and review each others code look for mistakes and ways to be more efficient.

## 10. Develop your code using version control and frequent updates!

## Lets try it!

```
data("faithful")
head(faithful)
foo <- faithful[ ,2]
mode(foo)
help(mode)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
Mode(foo)
hist(foo)
```

## Challenges

1. What other suggestions do you have?
2. Apply this advice to one of the scripts that you have already written.
