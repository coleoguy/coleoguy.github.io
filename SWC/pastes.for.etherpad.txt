BEST PRACTICES IN R PASTE IN WHEN WE GET READY TO GO

1) start code with a header
2) run import statements directly after the header
3) setwd() breaks stuff
4) use # to section of code
5) if you have functions put them up at the top don't bury them in your code
6) be consistent
7) if you have a script >100 lines your doing it wrong
8) have a directory structure that all projects have
9) peer review
10) use git and version control for your code

ok your turn copy this code and fix it up all pretty

data("faithful")
head(faithful)
foo <- faithful[ ,2]
mode(foo)
help(mode)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
Mode(foo)
hist(foo)
