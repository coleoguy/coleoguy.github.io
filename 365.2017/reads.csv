Lamb. ""Meiotic pairing constraints and the activity of sex chromosomes."" Journal of theoretical Biology 133.1 (1988): 23-36.",oldest example of the hypothesis that MSCI might be an adaptation for pairing"Misof, Bernhard, et al. ""Phylogenomics resolves the timing and pattern of insect evolution."" Science 346.6210 (2014): 763-767.",contains likely the best dates for most insect divergence time up till now. Leps and diptera about the same age and beetles about 260 MYA consistent with my inference"Mather, Kenneth. ""Crossing_over."" Biological Reviews 13.3 (1938): 252-292.",this is the first article that I know of that explicitly spells out the necessity of crossing over to insure segregation"Dumont, Beth L. ""Variation and Evolution of the Meiotic Requirement for Crossing Over in Mammals."" Genetics 205.1 (2017): 155-168.",here we see that some lineages require one crossover per arm while others require one per chromosome.  Not sure how this is affected by the fact that one type of recombination (the one that is sensitie to interference) was assayed"Borodin, Pavel M., et al. ""Multiple independent evolutionary losses of XY pairing at meiosis in the grey voles."" Chromosome research 20.2 (2012): 259-268.",documents number of transition to achiasmatic meiosis in microtus"Borodin, P. M., et al. ""Parallel occurrence of asynaptic sex chromosomes in gray voles (Microtus Schrank, 1798).""

""Rapid Karyotype Evolution in Lasiopodomys Involved at Least Two Autosome Sex Chromosome Translocations."" PloS one 11.12 (2016): e0167653.",Paper use chromosome paints based on single chromosome DNA ordered from CCCG - cambridge center for comparative genomics.  Looks like they have lots of species that you can work with them to get single chromosome sequences from. This might be a realistic way to get PAR data long read sequencing on X and Y specific data pools then assemble and map."Uematsu, Ayumi, et al. ""Parental origin of normal X chromosomes in Turner syndrome patients with various karyotypes: implications for the mechanism leading to generation of a 45, X karyotype.""ÊAmerican journal of medical geneticsÊ111.2 (2002): 134-139.","indicates that about 75% of the time the parent contributing the normal X chromosome in an XO offspring is the mother, or reversed that would mean that the father is at fault 75% of the time""Hassold, Terry J., and Patricia A. Jacobs. ""Trisomy in man.""ÊAnnual review of geneticsÊ18.1 (1984): 69-97.",this paper shows that aneuploidy in autosome is of maternal origin about 90% of the time a real contrast to what we see with the sex chromosomes"Lanier, Gerald N. ""Cytotaxonomy of Dendroctonus.""ÊApplication of Genetics and Cytology in Insect Systematics and Evolution, Proceedings of the 1980 Annual Meeting of the Entomological Society of America. Forest, Wildlife and Range Experimental Station, University of Idaho, Moscow, 1981.",this paper is the original source for much of the karyotype data for dendroctonus.  Specifically this was the source of data presented in smith and virkki 1978 and in one case they have included a typo so we have updated the CKD to reflect Lanier's original report."McClintock, Barbara. ""Induction of instability at selected loci in maize.""ÊGeneticsÊ38.6 (1953): 579.",McClintock's famous genetics paper. She discusses the ability of a transposition to influence expression of genes in the region of transposition. Especially amazing to remember that this is being done when we are just begiing to understand the structure of DNA and it would indeed be many years before the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this work would come to light."Riley, Bruce B., and Bryan T. Phillips. ""Ringing in the new ear: resolution of cell interactions in otic development.""ÊDevelopmental biologyÊ261.2 (2003): 289-312.",review of otic development particular focus on history and how we got here.  Intersting to note how much work waddington did in this forgot about his work in this area.  Induction start early hind brain particularly improtant but so are other tissues in area.  This was figured out in chicks and amphibians in the experiments where tissue is transpanted at different stages and locales to see if its fate has been set yet or if induction has occured. From the genetic perspective pax genes play a big role in particular pax2 and pax8 these are later downstream genes that mark otic development not the top of a cascade.  "Soh, YQ Shirleen, et al. ""Sequencing the mouse Y chromosome reveals convergent gene acquisition and amplification on both sex chromosomes.""ÊCellÊ159.4 (2014): 800-813.","2% derived from original autosome that became sex chromosome.  3 massively amplified gene families make up most of ""genic"" content.do have amplified homologs on mouse X but are absent from primate X.

""Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook.""ÊScienceÊ348.6239 (2015): 1130-1132.",This is one of the famous facebook articles basically it shows that most news that is shared is either very biased towards sharing among liberals or very biased to sharing among conservatives.  Few news items are shared at high rates among both groups.  Analysis of friend networks suggets that self-identified liberals have 20% conservative friends and conervatives have around 17% liberal friends.   Furthermore shows that even if our friend network is diverse people are less likeley to visit links to articles that do not align with their own political affiliation."Abascal, Federico, et al. ""Extreme genomic erosion after recurrent demographic bottlenecks in the highly endangered Iberian lynx.""ÊGenome BiologyÊ17.1 (2016): 251.",Many different signatures of maladaptive changes in this genome: 1) increased LINEs insertion that likely dissrupts translation observed 51% expected 37% 2) same basic story for SINEs. 3) lowest SNP/MB recorded "The genomic basis of adaptation to the deep water 'twilight zone' in Lake Malawi cichlid fishesChristoph Hahn, Martin J. Genner, George T. Turner, Domino A. JoycebioRxiv 102830; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/102830",Basic gwas looking for genes associated with selection for deep water habitat.  General idea was that species would partition habitat and thus areas of differentiation might be associated with niche partitioning.,,
