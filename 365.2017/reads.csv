""EpistasisÑthe essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems."" Nature Reviews Genetics 9.11 (2008): 855-867.",has a great line where he says that the subtly different meanings of epistasis have caused relatively few problems because different areas of genetics largely ignore each other.  Big distinction in meaning that is pointed to is the difference in molecular epistasis where one mutation overides another this was bateson's meaning and dealt with the absence or perturbation of expected segregation of discrete phenotypes in a dihybrid cross.  In contrast fisher borrowed this as 'epistacy' to describe statistical deviations from the expected additive effect of two loci.  Describes what he thinks are three good categories to divide the usage of epistasis among. 1) functional epistasis this is the molecular one we might think of as something like protein protein interactions within some pathway 2) compositional epistasis is next and here we might put all those uses where we are attempting to describe something akin to what bateson was describing when he coined the term so here we have a case where one locus overides another locus in this case we assume that all other loci are fixed across two genotypes being compared. 3) statistical epistasis this is the one I'm usually thinking about here we are looking at the effect of combinations of loci and their effect assuming the population genetic background.  This is the important thing to remember about statisticla epistasis because it is so context dependent we might not expect it to be terribly replicable.  This paper also has a great explanation of various ideas about adaptive landscapes (figure 4)."Aguilar-Rodr’guez, J., Payne, J. L., & Wagner, A. (2017). A thousand empirical adaptive landscapes and their navigability. Nature Ecology & Evolution, 1, 45. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0045",the data discussed here is binding affinities of different transcription factors to all possible 8 nucleotide sequences.  The key step in the logic is that substitutions to the 8 bp dna sequence can be thought of adaptation to particular transcription factors.42% of landscapes exhibit multiple peaks of differing heights.  In the empirical portion of the paper they also show that sites that have very high expression typically have sequences that are already <=1 mutational step from the highest affinity sequence. "Estimating correlated rates of trait evolution with uncertainty Daniel S.

This is a cool paper but I found the crosses performed to be more complicated than necessary.  They incorporate a masculizing mutation but I don’t see where they know if it is or isn't linked to insert location or why not cross with a standard male.  None the less its a great example of a novel (though likely rare?) origin for a sex chromosome"Mank, Judith E., David J. Hosken, and Nina Wedell.

Posits the idea that we might see quicker sex chromosome turnover on islands than mainlands the logic if I follow is based on the idea that in a small population the old Y will decay more quickly leading to less purifying selection maintaining it and thus when a new one arrises the loss of the old Y would be favoured.  Judith also talks about this conventional wisdom that perhaps young sex chromosomes can turnover more easily than old sex chromosomes I still cant decide if I agree that this should be our hypothesis we should really look at this empirically I feel like the most likely result is that we end yup with some kind of U shaped distribution where turnover is very common but rare in the middle? or maybe not maybe it is only predictiable if we account for the mode of dosage compensation and the level of degeneration of the Y"Husby, Arild, et al. ""Sex chromosome linked genetic variance and the evolution of sexual dimorphism of quantitative traits."" Evolution 67.3 (2013): 609-619.",often cited as showing that sexual dimorphism loci are not necessarily sex linked. Basically highlights the fact that you can have sexual dimorphism(resolved antagonism) without sex linkage.  The interesting thing to me is whether ithis necessarily is a sign of sex by autosomal epistasis seems like it must.  This study is based on long-term study sets focused on fly catchers and zebra finch that are pedigree and phenotyped every generation.  Some noise is introduced becuase of extra pair maitings (15%) but still pretty awesome dataset.  They use this in a an animal model to estimate addtive variance - autosomal and additive variance -z linked"Fairbairn, D. J., and D. A. Roff.

Heredity 97.5 (2006): 319-328.",nice look at the approaches that we can use to get at the quantitative genetics of sexual dimorphism it is especially interesting to think about how we can use these in the genomic age. Specifically how do we apply the animal model when we have sequencing across a hybrid zone or cline in some trait is this already done regularly? not sure seems like this could be promising. I don't quite understand some of the decisions in their thinking about line cross analysis.  The big power for it comes from the inclusion of sex by genetic effects to get at the true underlying nature of how dimorphism is produced maybe this wasnt competely clear or perhaps I am missing something.
