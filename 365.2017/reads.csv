Intersting to note how much work waddington did in this forgot about his work in this area.  Induction start early hind brain particularly improtant but so are other tissues in area.  This was figured out in chicks and amphibians in the experiments where tissue is transpanted at different stages and locales to see if its fate has been set yet or if induction has occured. From the genetic perspective pax genes play a big role in particular pax2 and pax8 these are later downstream genes that mark otic development not the top of a cascade.  "Soh, YQ Shirleen, et al.

Few news items are shared at high rates among both groups.  Analysis of friend networks suggets that self-identified liberals have 20% conservative friends and conervatives have around 17% liberal friends.   Furthermore shows that even if our friend network is diverse people are less likeley to visit links to articles that do not align with their own political affiliation."Abascal, Federico, et al.

""Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems."" Nature Reviews Genetics 9.11 (2008): 855-867.",has a great line where he says that the subtly different meanings of epistasis have caused relatively few problems because different areas of genetics largely ignore each other.  Big distinction in meaning that is pointed to is the difference in molecular epistasis where one mutation overides another this was bateson's meaning and dealt with the absence or perturbation of expected segregation of discrete phenotypes in a dihybrid cross.  In contrast fisher borrowed this as 'epistacy' to describe statistical deviations from the expected additive effect of two loci.  Describes what he thinks are three good categories to divide the usage of epistasis among. 1) functional epistasis this is the molecular one we might think of as something like protein protein interactions within some pathway 2) compositional epistasis is next and here we might put all those uses where we are attempting to describe something akin to what bateson was describing when he coined the term so here we have a case where one locus overides another locus in this case we assume that all other loci are fixed across two genotypes being compared. 3) statistical epistasis this is the one I'm usually thinking about here we are looking at the effect of combinations of loci and their effect assuming the population genetic background.  This is the important thing to remember about statisticla epistasis because it is so context dependent we might not expect it to be terribly replicable.  This paper also has a great explanation of various ideas about adaptive landscapes (figure 4)."Aguilar-Rodríguez, J., Payne, J. L., & Wagner, A. (2017). A thousand empirical adaptive landscapes and their navigability. Nature Ecology & Evolution, 1, 45. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0045",the data discussed here is binding affinities of different transcription factors to all possible 8 nucleotide sequences.  The key step in the logic is that substitutions to the 8 bp dna sequence can be thought of adaptation to particular transcription factors.42% of landscapes exhibit multiple peaks of differing heights.  In the empirical portion of the paper they also show that sites that have very high expression typically have sequences that are already <=1 mutational step from the highest affinity sequence. "Estimating correlated rates of trait evolution with uncertainty Daniel S.

Specifically it allows the incorporation of a shift in the tree using simulaitons they look at shifts in rates, integration, and orientation.

Importantly this approach allows us to incorporate all sorts of uncertainty (measures of tips values, ancestral states (for the reginme, etc.) done in an mcmc."
