This is just a quick little website to keep track of my reading.  If you are interested in the code used to generate it and why I am tracking my reading check out this blog post. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
dat = read.csv("reads.csv", as.is=T, header=F, fileEncoding = "latin1")
dat = cbind(1:nrow(dat),dat)
kable(dat, col.names=c("Count", "Paper", "Notes"))
```
