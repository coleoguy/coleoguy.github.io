When can we say anything about the cause of hybrid breakdown using a
line cross analysis approach? What data should we collect to be able to
identify the cause of the breakdown? A friend and I were discussing how
hard it can be to intuitevely have a good feel for the expected genetic
architecture even when the pattern is quite simple. In this instance we
were discussing a paper (Edmands and Deimler 2004 /Local adaptation,
intrinsic coadaptation and the effects of environmental stress on
interpopulation hybrids in the copepod Tigriopus californicus/ . This
paper reported that P1 and P2 are both fit but F1 crosses have reduced
fitness and F2 crosses are even less fit. The paper was looking for
local adaptation - so a pattern where each of these cohorts exhibits
higher fitness under conditions that “most” of its genome was selected
for. Akin to the idea of Rundle and Whitlock 2001 - Evolution paper
(Something that I hope to add to my LCA software soon). But for
simplicity here I am going to assume we don’t have local adaptation and
just think about intrinsic genetic incompatability. Since the paper
didn’t have any published data that I could crunch, I decided to just
make some up that would fit the pattern described.

We can use the R package SAGA to do the analysis and it will let us play
around with the assumed species characteristics quite easily. For
instance, is it XY or ZW or ESD? Do we really have P1, P2, F1, and F2 or
might we have P1, P2, rF1, and rF2.


    First we simulate some data

The standard dataset will be dataset one with P1, P2, F1, F2:

id 	fitness 	se.fit
3 	10 	0.2
6 	10 	0.2
9 	9 	0.2
15 	8 	0.2

Our alternate will be dataset two with P1, P2, rF1, rF2:

id 	fitness 	se.fit
3 	10 	0.2
6 	10 	0.2
12 	9 	0.2
24 	8 	0.2


    Analyze data

We have a total of 6 analyses we would like to do:

 1. XY sex determination
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2
 2. ESD sex determination
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2
 3. XY sex determination
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include rF1 and rF2
 4. ESD sex determination
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include rF1 and rF2
 5. XY sex determination cohorts
      * have unknown sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2
 6. ESD sex determination cohorts are unknown sex ratio
      * have unknown sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2

Briefly, the idea of ESD in the saga framework really just means that
their is no sex chromosome linked pattern of inheritance present in the
genome (though we do have maternal effects and cytotype effects).

Here is the code to run these six analyses

|res1 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data1, Cmatrix="XY", even.sex = T)
res2 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data1, Cmatrix="esd", even.sex = T)
res3 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data2, Cmatrix="XY", even.sex = T)
res4 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data2, Cmatrix="esd", even.sex = T)
res5 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data1, Cmatrix="XY", even.sex = F)
res6 <- SAGA::AnalyzeCrossesMM(data1, Cmatrix="esd", even.sex = F)|

First thing we might want to do is see if very simplistic datasets like
this even have a signal that supports one model more than another. As an
example the plot below shows the model weight across the 129 models that
can be examined under scenerio 1.

So now lets look at what our data would allow us to infer under each
scenario:

 1. XY sex determination - 129 models evaluated
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2

 

 

 2. ESD sex determination - 28 models evaluated
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2

 

 

 3. XY sex determination - 159 models evaluated
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include rF1 and rF2

 

 

 4. ESD sex determination - 35 models evaluated
      * cohorts have equal sex ratio
      * cohorts include rF1 and rF2

 

 

 5. XY sex determination cohorts - 28 models evaluated
      * have unknown sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2

 

 

 6. ESD sex determination cohorts are unknown sex ratio- 28 models
    evaluated
      * have unknown sex ratio
      * cohorts include F1 and F2

 

 


  Conclusions

First thing to notice is that we get a very different results in the
case where we assume no sex chromosomes but have F1 and F2 (dataset 2)
vs rF1 and rF2 (dataset 4). Dataset 2 suggests that we have dominant
maternal effect while datset 4 suggests that we have epistasis but with
no certainty.

When we make this same comparison under the assumptions of an XY sex
determination system we see that regardless of the type of F1 and F2 an
epistatic interaction between the mitochondria and an X are the best
explanation. This makes since if we think about how the genomes present
in F1 and F2 change.

The final problem that this little exploration illustrates is the
dangers of evaluating a tiny set of models in an information theory
framework. I’ve done some simulations previously and it seems that as
you attempt to use these approaches on an ever smaller set of models you
start putting too much support on the best of the remaining models.
Their isn’t an absolute measure of model fit but this might be a nice
extension is to report some general measure of % variance explained.
