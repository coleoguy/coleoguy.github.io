COLUMN NOTES:

Species name (Kingdom,Higher taxonomic group,Order,Family,Genus,species)

ThePlantListV1.1  (1=accepted at species level,-1=recognized synonym,0=other)
    1 if an "Accepted" species in The Plant List V1.1
    -1 if a synonym of another species (the synonym may or may not be recognized)
    0 may refer to varieties, unresolved species, or species not in The Plant List.

Name in ThePlantListV1.1
    The exact name of the species, as listed in The Plant List V1.1, for accepted species (1 in ThePlantListV1.1) and for species that are synonmys (-1 in ThePlantListV1.1).  In the latter case, the synonyms may or may not be resolved.

Intraspecific - As given in Genbank

Common name - As given in Genbank 

Hybrid
    1 = Species name indicates a hybrid (e.g., "Populus × berolinensis" or "Populus fremontii × Populus angustifolia")
If the accepted name included "×", then The Plant List was taken as an authority for the hybrid status of the species.
